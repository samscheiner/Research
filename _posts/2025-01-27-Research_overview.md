I am a theoretical biologist with work in various areas of evolution, ecology, and general biology. In evolution, I work on modeling phenotypic plasticity and the use of structural equation modeling for measuring trait relationships and natural selection. In ecology, I work on macroecological patterns of diversity, species richness relationships, and diversity metrics. In general biology, I am developing a set of general theories encompassing all of biology.

I have retired after serving for 26 years as a Program Director in the Division of Environmental Biology at the U.S. National Science Foundation. Previously I was an Associate Professor at Arizona State University West, and Assistant and Associate Professor at Northern Illinois University, and Adjunct Faculty at the University of Arizona. He received his BA, MS and PhD from the University of Chicago and is a AAAS Fellow.
