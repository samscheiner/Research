title: Daphnia plasticity experiments
date: 2025-01-28

The publications and data associated with two experiments concerning plasticity of Daphnia pulex in response to chemical signals from Chaoborus americanus. One set is related to our selection experiment where we varied patterns of temportal variation. One set is related ot our measurement of costs of plasticity. That data set is missing the data on metabolic rate. I have a data file with rate data, but could not make it line up with the published numbers; contact me if you are interested in those data. That file also contains a much more extensive number of traits than are in the published data. Finally, I have included a file of an unpublished experiment that was intended to measure maternal and grandmaternal effects. Unfortunately, contamination of the water supply killed the second generation.
