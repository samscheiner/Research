title: Drosophila experiments
date: 2025-01-28

The publications and data associated with four of my Drosophila papers are posted here on GitHub. These are the papers associated with The Genetics of Phenotypic Plasticity series I, II and III, as well as the life history correlations paper. All of those experiments are based on the same initial population of flies. If you use the data, please cite the original paper. You may contact me if you have any questions about them.
